Lower Priority Tasks still to be completed::


element_propsdlg:
        Better layout with sizers or whatnot, perhaps moving from a ListCtrl
               to an UltimateListCtrl?
        Default value of drop-down menu combo box needs to be correct
        Show the current specified color somehow (text color, higlight, etc)
        Offer a color wheel selector
        Show a preview of the element (including the current data inside)
