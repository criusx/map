# Not-recently used cache. Evicts things that haven't been used in a while (wall-clock-time) regardless of need for
# space. Becomes a LRU-cache if capacity is hit, though if capacity is reached the cache should be enlarged since this
# is intended to store information requested in batches. If one piece of the batch cannot fit in the cache that is a
# performance problem and there will be thrashing.
#
# The expiration time here is very coarse. This is intended for tiny caches
#
# Removal works as such:
#   While over capacity, oldest items are generally removed with the caveat that expiring elements might be artificially
#   kept alive due the details of the implementation. This is OK since capacity is a safety feature only. If this
#   happens often, the cache should just be be made larger.
#
#   When setting or accessing an item, a clean is triggered
#     In this clean, any items `expiration_s` older than the next item are marked as expired and re-inserted into the
#     data structure as if newly modified.
#     If such an expired item is once again found to be older than `expiration_s` compared to the next item, it will be
#     removed.
#
#  The removal policy allows a batch of requests to touch the cache after a long period of time without immediately
#  deleting everything upon the first access.
#
# The nature of cleaning old requests this way requires that the cache not be very large.
