This was the initial PROTOTYPE for a branch predictor tool with heatmaps.
It is client-side only, entirely javscript + html, and uses plotly for plotting.

The data shown is not 100% correct, it does not handle large input files, and there
are bugs... therefore this should not be used for any real analysis.
